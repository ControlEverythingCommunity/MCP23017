http://pi4j.com/install.html

Download (or git pull) the code in pi.

Compile the java program.
```cpp
$> pi4j Sample#.java
```

Run the java program as.
```cpp
$> pi4j Sample#
```

##Python 
Download and install smbus library on Raspberry pi. Steps to install smbus are provided at:

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/smbus-cffi/0.5.1

Download (or git pull) the code in pi. Run the program

```cpp
$> python Sample#.py
```

## Arduino
Download and install Arduino Software (IDE) on your machine. Steps to install Arduino are provided at:

https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software

Download (or git pull) the code and double click the file to run the program.

## Particle Photon

Login to your Photon and setup your device according to steps provided at:

https://docs.particle.io/guide/getting-started/connect/photon/

Download (or git pull) the code. Go to online IDE and copy the code.

https://build.particle.io/build/

Verify and flash the code on your Photon. Code output is shown in logs at dashboard:

https://dashboard.particle.io/user/logs

## C

Download (or git pull) the code in Beaglebone Black.

Compile the c program.
```cpp
$>gcc Sample#.c -o Sample#
```
Run the c program.
```cpp
$>./Sample#
```

Sample1 code turns all relays ON at once.

Sample2 code turns all relays ON one by one and then turn all relays OFF one by one. 

Sample3 code turns pull-up registers high at once.

Sample4 code turns pull-up registers high one by one and then turns pull-up registers low one by one.

Sample5 code turns pull-up registers high at once and then turn GPIO pins HIGH and LOW.
